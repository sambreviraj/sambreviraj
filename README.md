- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!! I am a 25-year-old based in New York. I believe the hardest thing is to choose what matters, and as an analyst, I have learned the skill of prioritizing. As a child, I have always been able to predictively analyze a product or company as well. I am a core analyst which can be witnessed in even the smallest things. Iâ€™m a critical thinker with a keen attention to detail.
